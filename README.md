# Library-Management-System
 Library Management System is a C++ project designed for managing library operations, specifically tailored for admins and librarians. The system allows the admin to sign up librarians and make necessary changes according to library rules.
 Librarians can log in to their accounts and perform various tasks such as adding, deleting, searching, updating books and borrowers, and issuing and returning books. This system utilizes file handling methods to manage data efficiently.
